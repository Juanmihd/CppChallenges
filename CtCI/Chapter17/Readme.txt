
This part of my CPP training consist in the resolution of the exercises of the
chapter 17: Moderate:

17.1 Write a function to swap a number in place (that is, without temporary
variables)

17.2 Design an algorithm to figure out if someone has won a game of
tic-tac-toe

17.3 Write an algorithm which computes the number of trailing zeros in n
factorial

17.4 Write a method which finds the maximum of two numbers. You should not use
if-else or any other comparison operator

17.5 The Game of Master Mind is played as follows:
The computer has four slots, and each slot will contain a ball that is red
(R), yellow (Y), green (G) or blue (B). For example, the computer might have
RGGB.
You, the user, are trying to guess the solution. You might, for example, guess
YRGB.
There are hits and pseudo hits. Hits = right color in position. PseudoHit =
right colour wron position.
