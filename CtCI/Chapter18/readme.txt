Problems not yet solved of chapter 18


18.4 Write a method to count the number of 2s that appear in all the numbers between 0 and n (inclusive).
Example:
Input: 25
Output: 9 (2, 12, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24 and 25. Not that 22 counts for two 2s).

18.5 You have a large text file containing words. Given any two words, find the shortest distance
(in term of number of words) between them in the file. If the operation will be repeated many times for
the same file (but different pairs of words), can you optimize the solution?

18.6 Describe an algorithm to find the smallest one million numbers in one billion numbers.
Assume that the computer memory can hold all one billion numbers.

18.7 Given a list of words, write a program to find the longest word made of other words on the list.
Example
Input: cat, banana, dog, nana, walk, walker, dogwalker
Output: dogwalker

18.8 Given a string s and an array of smallers string T, design a method to search same
for each small string in T.

18.9 Numbers are randomly generated and passed to a method. Write a program to find an mantain
the median value as new values are generated.

18.10 Given two words of equal lenght that are in a dictionary, write a method to transform one
word into another word by changing only one letter at a time.
example
input: DAMP, LIKE
output: DAMP -> LAMP -> LIMP -> LIME -> LIKE

18.11 Imagine you have a square matrix, where each cell (pixel) is either black or white.
Design an algorithm to find the maximum subsquare such that all four borders are filled
with black pixels.

18.12 Given an NxN matrix of positive and negative integers, write code to find the submatrix
with the largest possible sum.

18.13 Given a list of millions of words, design an algorithm to create the largest possible rectangle
of letters such that every row forms a word (reading left to right) and ey column forms a word (reading
top to bottom). The words need not be chosen consecutively from the list, but all rows must be the same
lenght and all columns must be the same height.
